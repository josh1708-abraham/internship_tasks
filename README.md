# Titanic Task 1 – Data Cleaning

This project cleans the Titanic dataset by:
- Removing missing values
- Removing outliers using IQR method
- Preparing the data for machine learning

Uploaded:
- `cleaned_train.csv`
- `cleaned_test.csv`
- Kaggle notebook


Task 2: Summary Statistics
In this task, we calculated basic summary statistics for the Titanic dataset. These statistics help us understand the distribution and central tendencies of numerical columns.

🔍 Dataset Used:
train.csv from Kaggle’s Titanic dataset

📌 Columns analyzed:
Age — Passenger age

Fare — Ticket fare

SibSp — Number of siblings/spouses aboard

Parch — Number of parents/children aboard

🧮 Statistics Calculated:
For each column above, we calculated:

Mean – Average value

Median – Middle value



# Iris Dataset - Task 3: Data Visualization 🌸📊

This project is part of an internship learning task focused on data visualization using Python.

## 📌 Task Objective

**Visualize the distribution of features in the Iris dataset** using histograms.

- Load the Iris dataset
- Drop unnecessary columns
- Plot histograms for all numeric columns
- Use Seaborn for styled plots with KDE (curve overlay)

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is the famous **Iris flower dataset**, which includes 150 records of 3 iris species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

Each record contains:
- `SepalLengthCm`
- `SepalWidthCm`
- `PetalLengthCm`
- `PetalWidthCm`
- `Species` (target)

---

## 📊 Visualization Output

Histograms are plotted for the following numeric columns:
- SepalLengthCm
- SepalWidthCm
- PetalLengthCm
- PetalWidthCm

Each plot includes:
- Histogram (bar chart)
- KDE curve (smooth line for distribution)

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Kaggle Notebook

---

## 📌 Sample Output

*You can include screenshots of your histograms here if you'd like.*

---

## 🧠 Learnings

- How to use `pandas` to handle and clean datasets.
- How to use `seaborn.histplot()` to plot histograms with KDE.
- How to create subplots using `matplotlib.pyplot`.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-visualization-task.git


Mode – Most frequent value

Standard Deviation – Measure of spread or dispersion
